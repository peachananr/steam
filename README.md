The rendering stack used by both Wagon and Engine. It includes:

- the rack stack to serve assets (SCSS, Coffeescript, ...etc) and pages.
- the liquid drops/filters/tags libs to parse and render liquid templates.
- a Filesystem adapter which reads the source of a site written for Wagon.
- a MongoDB adapter which reads an existing site hosted by the Locomotive Engine.

**Note:** Steam passes all the specifications of both Wagon and Engine.

## Installation [WIP]

```bash
gem install puma
gem install locomotivecms_steam
```

## Usage

### Command line:

*Warning*: For now, Steam is not aimed to be run standalone. The following is just a proof of concept.

Display all the options:

```bash
steam --help
```

Render a local Wagon site:

```bash
steam --path=<PATH to a Wagon site>
```

Render a Engine site:

```bash
steam --database=<NAME of the MongoDB database used by the Engine> --assets-path=<PATH to the public folder of the Locomotive>
```

Once launched, open your browser

```bash
open localhost:8080
```
